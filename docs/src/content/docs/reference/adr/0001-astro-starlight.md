# ADR-0001: Use Astro Starlight for Documentation

## Status

**Accepted**

**Date**: 2024-10-09

## Context

The Template repository requires comprehensive, maintainable, and user-friendly documentation. We need a documentation framework that:

### Current Situation

- Starting a new template repository
- No existing documentation infrastructure
- Need to support multiple documentation types (tutorials, guides, reference, explanations)
- Must be easy for contributors to maintain
- Should follow modern documentation best practices

### Constraints

- Must be free and open-source
- Should integrate with GitHub
- Must support Markdown
- Need good developer experience
- Should be performant and SEO-friendly

### Requirements

- Support for Diataxis documentation methodology
- Built-in search functionality
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Dark mode support
- Easy navigation and sidebar
- Code syntax highlighting
- Support for custom components
- Easy deployment (static site)

## Decision Drivers

- **Developer Experience**: Easy to write and maintain documentation
- **User Experience**: Fast, accessible, beautiful documentation site
- **Maintenance**: Low maintenance overhead
- **Flexibility**: Ability to customize and extend
- **Performance**: Fast page loads and good SEO
- **Community**: Active community and good documentation
- **Modern Stack**: Based on modern web technologies

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Astro Starlight

- Great documentation and examples
- Active development and community
- Easy customization
- Mobile-responsive
- Accessibility built-in

**Cons**:
- Relatively newer than some alternatives
- Smaller ecosystem compared to older tools
- May need custom components for advanced features

**Example**:
```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      title: 'Template Docs',
      sidebar: [
        { label: 'Getting Started', link: '/getting-started/' },
        { label: 'Guides', autogenerate: { directory: 'guides' } },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Option 2: Docusaurus

**Description**: Facebook's documentation framework, built on React.

**Pros**:
- Mature and battle-tested
- Large community and ecosystem
- Rich plugin ecosystem

- i18n support

**Cons**:
- React-specific (adds bundle size)
- More complex setup
- Slower build times
- Heavier client bundle
- More configuration needed
- Not as modern developer experience

### Option 3: VitePress

**Description**: Vue-powered static site generator, successor to VuePress.

**Pros**:

- Good performance
- Vue ecosystem
- Clean design
- Good developer experience

**Cons**:
- Vue-specific
- Less documentation-focused features
- Smaller community than Docusaurus

## Decision

We have decided to go with **Option 1: Astro Starlight** for our documentation framework.

### Rationale

1. **Purpose-Built**: Starlight is specifically designed for documentation sites, with all the features we need built-in
2. **Performance**: Astro's static site generation provides excellent performance and SEO
3. **Developer Experience**: Markdown/MDX support with minimal configuration needed
4. **User Experience**: Beautiful, accessible design out of the box with dark mode and responsive layout
5. **Modern Stack**: Uses modern web technologies aligned with our tech stack
6. **Diataxis Support**: Easy to structure documentation following Diataxis methodology
7. **Future-Proof**: Active development and growing community

## Consequences

### Positive

- Fast, performant documentation site with excellent SEO
- Easy for contributors to write documentation in Markdown
- Beautiful, accessible design without custom styling
- Built-in features (search, navigation, dark mode) save development time
- Can easily customize with Astro components if needed
- Great developer experience for documentation authors
- Excellent documentation and examples from Starlight

### Negative

- Team needs to learn Astro basics (though minimal for docs)
- Smaller ecosystem than Docusaurus (fewer third-party plugins)
- Some advanced features may require custom development

### Neutral

- Need to maintain Astro dependency
- Documentation is in separate directory with own package.json

### Risks

- **Risk**: Astro/Starlight development slows down
  - **Mitigation**: Astro has strong backing and active community. Can migrate to another framework if needed.
- **Risk**: Missing features we need later
  - **Mitigation**: Astro is highly extensible. Can build custom features or integrate other tools.

## Appendix

### Alternative Approaches Considered

We also briefly considered:
- Custom documentation site (too much work)
- GitHub Wiki (too limited)
- README-only approach (insufficient for comprehensive docs)

### Discussion Summary

The team agreed that documentation quality is critical for template adoption. Astro Starlight provides the best balance of ease-of-use for contributors and excellent user experience for readers.

### Future Considerations

- May add i18n support if international users request it
- Could add versioned documentation if multiple template versions are maintained
- Might integrate with API documentation tools if template includes APIs
